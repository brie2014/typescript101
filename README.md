# Overview

This is a compilation of basic projects that can be completed to learn TypeScript. TypeScript is essentially a typed version of JavaScript, and has a lot of similarities, but also a lot of nuances. TypeScript extends JavaScript, and can provide a better developer experience. It is also a great way to get introduced to typed language, especially if you already know JavaScript.

[Demo Video]()

This project contains 4 subprojects that demonstrate different principles and elements of TypeScript

- Project 1: Hello World (terminal output)
- Project 2: Basic Drawing App (classes, event handlers)
- Project 3: Joke Fetcher (asynchronous functions, terminal output, lists, loops)
- Project 4: Fibonacci (recursion, terminal output)
- Stretch Goal: TS Lint

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

**Requirements**

- [X] Display output to the terminal.
- [X] Recursion
- [X] Classes
- [X] Lists
- [X] Asynchronous functions
- [X] Stretch goal: TS Lint (deprecated so used TypeScript-ESLint instead)

# Future Work

- Add support for touch events in drawing app (for mobile/touch screen devices)
- Make save button persist background color and be more secure
- Allow user more control over joke generator (categories, languages, number of jokes, etc.)
- Convert existing JS project to TS to better master the syntax
